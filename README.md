# Foodie

### General info

In this project all JavaScript code was written along with lessons on Udemy. It was the first time for me to work with a such complex project. After understanding how everything works, I think it's pretty great base to continue learning.

I've learned about NPM, how asynchronous JavaScript works, how to fetch data from API, how to use local storage, what is MCV architecture and why it's important to keep code organized, how to display fetched data on the screen, how to build basic pagination and few more things.

Except JavaScript, the rest of project was written by myself. At first I've used CSS for styling but at the end my code was way too long and way too unorganized. I've decided to learn SCSS and now I think it's much better and so much organized and by that- easier to read.

I've also learned one thing - if it will be possible I will never ever again use Parcel ;)
The amount of problems I've faced with this bundler was enormous. It's good reason to learn webpack.
